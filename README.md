# InvizaShield

## This application will stand as a gift to my father to be used for his business, Invizashield LLC, and serve as a grand gesture of appreciation and gratitude for his support thorugh this transitional period of my life going from 'shop boy' to Software Engineer. The goal of building this application was to create a website that brings Invizashield's online presence into a higher class. It was built with the styling intentions to deliver information to clients that will catch the eye and provide persuasive bits of information to earn business. User account creation allows for streamlined communications between my father and his client's and email components built into the site also allow for quick messaging from clients directly to my father's email.
